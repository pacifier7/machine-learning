    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "1. **DECISION TREE:** Decision tree algorithm, due to its unique property of taking various variables as test that guides its classification decision, it would be especially useful in medicine. The medical field bases a lot of its diagnosis decisions on collecting variables in form of history, examination and investigation findings to make decisions on nature of illness, best form of treatment, and monitoring of progress of treatment. Decision tree algorithm would be invaluable in such a setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following advantages:\n",
    "- Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "- It is easy to understand, interpret and also easy to explain.\n",
    "- Can also be combined with other decision techniques and ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is most useful in a setting that requires exploration of various combination of variables and the outcome they would give.\n",
    "\n",
    "It however has the following disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are often relatively inaccurate when compared with other classification algorithm on the same data.\n",
    "- Slight change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is less useful in situations where the outcomes are linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good candidate for the above data because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Majority of the variables are categorical (8/13).\n",
    "- The analysis also involves making a classification decision on an individual's earning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**RANDOM FOREST** Random forest or random decision forests due to it's inherent property of combining various decision trees to improve accuracy is used to improve accuracy of prediction in a situation that has a large number of variables. An example is in the world of finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following advantages:\n",
    "- It's associated with a lesser degree of variance (i.e. overfitting) as compared to using a single decision tree.\n",
    "- It has a higher degree of accuracy.\n",
    "- Copes well with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following disadvantage:\n",
    "- Harder to understand the inner workings of a model, compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- More time consuming to construct and run compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is suitable for this data because it is built on combining decision trees, and decision tree is a suitable algorithm for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES** it shows high accuracy in terms of text and hypertext categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following advantages:\n",
    "- low risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- It works well with complex data.\n",
    "- Works well, even with unstructured data like texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the following disadvantages:\n",
    "- Also difficult to unerstand the inner workings of the model.\n",
    "- Choosing a good kernel function is not easy.\n",

    "The best model for solving our problem of classifying individuals into groups that earn more than $50000 annually and those that earn less is based on an algorithm called Random Forest Classifier. \n",
    "This algorithm is an ensemble method (i.e. methods that make predictions by combining other basic methods).Being an ensemble method, it's basic algorithm is called decision tree classifier.\n",
    "To know how Random forest works, we must first know how decision tree works. Decision tree, just like every other machine learning algorithm goes through two phases before being ready to be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Training.\n",
    "-Testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like it's name suggest, it can be said to build a TREE out of our data with the fruit from the tree being the DECISION, and the aim of this process being to make the right DECISION. \n",
    "So, for our data, all the features save the income would be the different parts of the TREE while the income (whether the individual earns more or less than $50000 ) being the fruit of the tree. \n",
    "So, the TRAINING phase involves the algorithm learning from our data the right way of combining the features in order to make the right decision i.e. building the right tree(combining the features) that would produce the right fruit(income of the individual).\n",
    "The TESTING phase then involves us checking how well our tree can produce the right fruit(maybe by tasting!). \n",
    "However, the Random forest goes a step further by combining a number of TREES in order to create a stronger FOREST."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
